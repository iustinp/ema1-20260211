# Contributing to Project Helix

This project (like almost all of Project Helix) is an Open Development project and welcomes contributions from everyone who finds it useful or lacking.

## Code Of Conduct

This project adheres to the Adobe [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to cstaub at adobe dot com.

## Contributor License Agreement

All third-party contributions to this project must be accompanied by a signed contributor license. This gives Adobe permission to redistribute your contributions as part of the project. [Sign our CLA](http://opensource.adobe.com/cla.html)! You only need to submit an Adobe CLA one time, so if you have submitted one previously, you are good to go!

## Things to Keep in Mind

This project uses a **commit then review** process, which means that for approved maintainers, changes can be merged immediately, but will be reviewed by others.

For other contributors, a maintainer of the project has to approve the pull request.

# Before You Contribute

* Check that there is an existing issue in GitHub issues
* Check if there are other pull requests that might overlap or conflict with your intended contribution

# How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Make some changes on a branch on your fork
3. Create a pull request from your branch

In your pull request, outline:

* What the changes intend
* How they change the existing code
* If (and what) they breaks
* Start the pull request with the GitHub issue ID, e.g. #123

Lastly, please follow the [pull request template](.github/pull_request_template.md) when submitting a pull request!

Each commit message that is not part of a pull request:

* Should contain the issue ID like `#123`
* Can contain the tag `[trivial]` for trivial changes that don't relate to an issue



## Coding Styleguides

We enforce a coding styleguide using `eslint`. As part of your build, run `npm run lint` to check if your code is conforming to the style guide. We do the same for every PR in our CI, so PRs will get rejected if they don't follow the style guide.

You can fix some of the issues automatically by running `npx eslint . --fix`.

## Commit Message Format

This project uses a structured commit changelog format that should be used for every commit. Use `npm run commit` instead of your usual `git commit` to generate commit messages using a wizard.

```bash
# either add all changed files
$ git add -A
# or selectively add files
$ git add package.json
# then commit using the wizard
$ npm run commit
```

# How Contributions get Reviewed

One of the maintainers will look at the pull request within one week. Feedback on the pull request will be given in writing, in GitHub.

# Release Management

The project's committers will release to the [Adobe organization on npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com/org/adobe).
Please contact the [Adobe Open Source Advisory Board](https://git.corp.adobe.com/OpenSourceAdvisoryBoard/discuss/issues) to get access to the npmjs organization.

The release process is fully automated using `semantic-release`, increasing the version numbers, etc. based on the contents of the commit messages found.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

When countries have access to timely and reliable data, they can make better decisions, design more effective policies, and monitor progress in real time. Yet, many developing countries still face data gaps that hinder planning and service delivery. Investing in data systems helps governments and partners uncover insights, track inequality, improve targeting, and respond quickly to crises. Strengthening data capacity is essential to making development more inclusive, accountable, and results-driven.</div>
